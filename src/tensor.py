If you're familiar with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html){:.external}, tensors are (kind of) like `np.arrays`.

All tensors are immutable like Python numbers and strings: you can never update the contents of a tensor, only create a new one.

Tensors have shapes.  Some vocabulary:

* **Shape**: The length (number of elements) of each of the axes of a tensor.
* **Rank**: Number of tensor axes.  A scalar has rank 0, a vector has rank 1, a matrix is rank 2.
* **Axis** or **Dimension**: A particular dimension of a tensor.
* **Size**: The total number of items in the tensor, the product of the shape vector's elements.

Note: Although you may see reference to a "tensor of two dimensions", a rank-2 tensor does not usually describe a 2D space.

Tensors and `tf.TensorShape` objects have convenient properties for accessing these:

## Indexing

### Single-axis indexing

TensorFlow follows standard Python indexing rules, similar to [indexing a list or a string in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings){:.external}, and the basic rules for NumPy indexing.

* indexes start at `0`
* negative indices count backwards from the end
* colons, `:`, are used for slices: `start:stop:step`

"""If you flatten a tensor you can see what order it is laid out in memory."""

# A `-1` passed in the `shape` argument says "Whatever fits".

You may run across not-fully-specified shapes. Either the shape contains a `None` (an axis-length is unknown) or the whole shape is `None` (the rank of the tensor is unknown).

Except for [tf.RaggedTensor](#ragged_tensors), such shapes will only occur in the context of TensorFlow's symbolic, graph-building  APIs:

* [tf.function](function.ipynb)
* The [keras functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional).

## More on `DTypes`

To inspect a `tf.Tensor`'s data type use the `Tensor.dtype` property.

When creating a `tf.Tensor` from a Python object you may optionally specify the datatype.

If you don't, TensorFlow chooses a datatype that can represent your data. TensorFlow converts Python integers to `tf.int32` and Python floating point numbers to `tf.float32`. Otherwise TensorFlow uses the same rules NumPy uses when converting to arrays.

You can cast from type to type.
"""

# Now, cast to an uint8 and lose the decimal precision
the_u8_tensor = tf.cast(the_f16_tensor, dtype=tf.uint8)
print(the_u8_tensor)

"""## Broadcasting

Broadcasting is a concept borrowed from the [equivalent feature in NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html){:.external}.  In short, under certain conditions, smaller tensors are "stretched" automatically to fit larger tensors when running combined operations on them.

The simplest and most common case is when you attempt to multiply or add a tensor to a scalar.  In that case, the scalar is broadcast to be the same shape as the other argument.
"""

x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])

y = tf.constant(2)
z = tf.constant([2, 2, 2])
# All of these are the same computation
print(tf.multiply(x, 2))
print(x * y)
print(x * z)

"""Likewise, axes with length 1 can be stretched out to match the other arguments.  Both arguments can be stretched in the same computation.

In this case a 3x1 matrix is element-wise multiplied by a 1x4 matrix to produce a 3x4 matrix. Note how the leading 1 is optional: The shape of y is `[4]`.

"""Most of the time, broadcasting is both time and space efficient, as the broadcast operation never materializes the expanded tensors in memory.

"""

print(tf.broadcast_to(tf.constant([1, 2, 3]), [3, 3]))

"""Unlike a mathematical op, for example, `broadcast_to` does nothing special to save memory.  Here, you are materializing the tensor.

It can get even more complicated.  [This section](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.05-computation-on-arrays-broadcasting.html){:.external} of Jake VanderPlas's book _Python Data Science Handbook_ shows more broadcasting tricks (again in NumPy).

## tf.convert_to_tensor

Most ops, like `tf.matmul` and `tf.reshape` take arguments of class `tf.Tensor`.  However, you'll notice in the above case, Python objects shaped like tensors are accepted.

Most, but not all, ops call `convert_to_tensor` on non-tensor arguments.  There is a registry of conversions, and most object classes like NumPy's `ndarray`, `TensorShape`, Python lists, and `tf.Variable` will all convert automatically.

See `tf.register_tensor_conversion_function` for more details, and if you have your own type you'd like to automatically convert to a tensor.

## Ragged Tensors

A tensor with variable numbers of elements along some axis is called "ragged". Use `tf.ragged.RaggedTensor` for ragged data.
